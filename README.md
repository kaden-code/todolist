# Todo App - Learning JavaScript Project

## Overview
An interactive to-do list app representing my first true front-end project. After mastering HTML structure and CSS styling in previous projects, JavaScript was the final piece needed to create truly interactive web applications. This project applies all three technologies together, creating something useful that responds to user input in real-time. Users simply type a task, click the "+" button, and watch as it dynamically appears with check and trash icons for managing completed tasks.
